chose to make a package inspired by an open ended datavis assignment in a Big Data with Python course.

Visualize NYC EMS emergencies with gifs and images created with one line in this ingeniously-named package. 

Slice by:
  - day of week (1-7)
  - week of year(1-52)
  - hour of day (0-23)

Aggregate yearly statistics on:
  - one type of ambulance call emergency i.e. struck pedestrian
  - a list emergency types i.e. struck pedestrian & automobile accident & non-motor vehicle accident

Customize output gif:
  - labels, speed, colormap, whether or not to include staten island (no offense, it just greatly reduces scale of other 4 boroughs)
  
See the two gifs in the repo.
